Emacs mode for D major mode and the dlint syntax and warning minor mode.

For more information see http://home.comcast.net/~benhinkle

Put the d-mode.el and other .el files into your emacs site-lisp directory.
The cc-engine.el file is a slightly modified version of the
one from emacs-21.2 to have the following line:

  ((and (not (c-major-mode-is 'd-mode)) (c-just-after-func-arglist-p))
instead of
  ((c-just-after-func-arglist-p)

Replace the cc-engine.el file in lisp/progmodes with this one.

Load the files into emacs and run
  M-x byte-compile-file RET RET 
to compile it into a .elc file

Add this to your .emacs file:

(autoload 'd-mode "d-mode" 
  "Major mode for editing D code." t)
(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '( "\\.d\\'" . d-mode ) auto-mode-alist ))
(autoload 'dlint-minor-mode "dlint" nil t)
(add-hook 'd-mode-hook (lambda () (dlint-minor-mode 1)))

The dlint minor mode needs to be able to find the phobos standard library
sources for resolving imports. The path to the root of phobos should be
put into sc.ini on Windows or /etc/dmd.conf on Linux.
